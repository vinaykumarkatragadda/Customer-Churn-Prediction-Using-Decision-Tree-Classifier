# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree-Classifier
Built a Decision Tree model to predict telecom customer churn using categorical and numerical data. Performed EDA, One-Hot Encoding, Min-Max Scaling, and tuned hyperparameters (max_depth, min_samples_split, ccp_alpha) to improve accuracy and model interpretability.
